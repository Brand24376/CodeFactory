# Documentation on CodeFactory: #

**Description:**
CodeFactory is a 3D Sandbox game with robots. In this game you will start off from scratch with basically nothing at all and you will have to build a society to your liking (or not build one at all, that is also an option). You will upgrade from just using your bare hands and tools to gather resources, craft things, and build things, to using robots to not only do these things automatically for you, but do them better. You will be able to collect various resources to help you become more advanced and the more advanced you get the more advanced things you can do (especially with the robots).

**Installing Unity Hub and Unity Editor:**
* Install the Unity Hub through the Unity website. Link to the Unity Hub download: <https://unity.com/unity-hub>. If this link doesn't take you to the download, the very first link when searching up Unity Hub on Google should.
* The Unity Editor version used for this project is 2019.2.8f1 so you just need to install version 2019.2.8. There are 2 ways of installing this Unity Editor version. Option 1 is going directly to the link (Unity Editor 2019.2.8 Link: <https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2019.2.8>). Option 2 which is probably the easier way to download it is to just simply open the project in Unity Hub (explained later in the documentation). If you don't have the correct version of the Unity Hub it will tell you to install the exact version that is needed to open the project. If you download it this way make sure to have Visual Studio downloading as well (if you prefer it over VScode) since it will give you the option of downloading both at the same time.

**Installing GitHub Desktop:**
* Install Github Desktop through Github's webstite. Link to the Github Desktop download: <https://desktop.github.com/>. If this link doesn't take you to the download, the very first link when searching up Github Desktop on Google should.

**Installing VScode or Visual Studio:**
* Note: There are more code editors than just these that you can use. These are just the most popular ones right now so it is recomended that you use them.
* Install VScode through the VScode webstie. Link to the VScode download: <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>. If this link doesn't take you to the download, the very first link when searching up VScode on Google should.
* You have 2 ways of installing Visual Studio. Option 1 was the way I mentioned when installing the correct Unity Editor. Option 2 is installing Visual Studio through the Visual Studio website (you can also download VScode through this website). Link to the Visual Studio download: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>. If this link doesn't take you to the download, the very first link when searching up Visual Studio on Google should.

**Github Setup:**
* Make a fork of CodeFactory by going to the fork button and pressing create a new fork.
* Clone your fork of CodeFactory by pressing the code button on your fork then pressing opening with Github desktop and then on Github desktop saving it where you want it to be cloned.

**Unity Hub Setup:**
* In the Projects Tab of the Unity Hub, select add, then go to the folder where you cloned your fork, enter the folder and double click the Codeactory folder inside. The project should now appear in the Unity Hub and can then be entered by just clicking it.

**Code Editor Setup:**
* In your code editor of choice, open your local CodeFactory folder (the one you cloned from your fork earlier). You should now be able to edit all the files inside the CodeFactory folder. **Note: If you are using VScode, make sure to install the C# extension. If you are using Visual Studio, go to tools at the top bar, select get tools and feature, and make sure that game development with Unity is selected. Other code editors might have options like this so make sure that you research if your preferred code editor has any of these options.**

**Github Use:**
* **Important Note:** Make sure to fetch the origin and merge with upstream main BEFORE opening the project in Unity Hub (if merging creates conflicts with your clone, make sure to create a backup of the whole project somewhere safe *desktop recommended* and then discard changes to pull the newest version to ensure that work is not overwritten).
* Whenever your changes are done, make sure to CLOSE UNITY before committing your changes to your fork.

**Code Editor Use:**
* Main important thing to remember is to always save your work and try to follow the same syntax that is used for the other scripts so that the code is more clean.

**Unity Use:**
* It is recomended that you watch a Unity tutorial if you don't know anything about Unity or how to use a game engine. Just experiment with it so you can learn how to use and navigate it. Unity themselves have a bunch of documentaion and tutorials to help beginners.

**Main Unity Documentation: <https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.2/Documentation/Manual/index.html>**
* Make sure that the documenation is on 2019.2 since anything later might have features that the version we are using doesn't have and anything before might not have features that the version we are using has.
